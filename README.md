## JavaScript project one for The Odin Project Foundations course

### Project Goals:

The goal of this project is both to gain experience working with basic JavaScript, as well as to practice & cement a basic problem-solving framework that can be applied to other problems moving forward.

My intention is to focus on the following areas when completing this project:

- Utilize the problem solving framework of understand, plan, and divide & conquer, as laid out in the Odin Project problem solving lesson
- Practice taking the time to slow down and properly understand a problem, while checking for assumptions you may have that may not be correct
- Plan how to move forward in solving the problem, including thinking about how the program will be displayed, what the input and output should be, and what the required steps will be from input to output to get the desired result
- Lay these steps out into pseudocode to develop an algorithm to solve the problem, before a single line of code is written
- Use the pseudocode as guideposts to break the problem down into smaller, more manageable problems that can be solved one by one without becoming overwhelming
- Test each chunk of code as it is written to make sure that it is working as expected, to help avoid searching for bugs in the entire program
- When problems arise, practice proper debugging techniques using dev tools, the debugger, and console.log, as well as being sure to properly read & understand any errors that crop up
- Proper use of googling to understand what errors mean and what can cause them
